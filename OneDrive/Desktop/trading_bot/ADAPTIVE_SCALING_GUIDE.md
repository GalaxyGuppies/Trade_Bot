| $0 - $499 | 1.0x | Conservative $100 base positions |
| $500+ | 1.2x | $120 positions (20% increase) |

## 🎯 How Adaptive Scaling Works

### **As Profits Increase:**
1. **Position sizes scale up** - More capital deployed per trade
2. **Profit targets increase** - Higher returns on successful trades
3. **Risk management tightens** - Better protection of accumulated profits

### **During Losing Streaks:**
1. **Position sizes reduce** - Capital protection mode
2. **Trading may pause** - After 5+ consecutive losses
3. **Recovery protocols activate** - Gradual scaling back up

### **Confidence-Based Adjustments:**
- **90%+ confidence**: 1.5x position size boost
- **80%+ confidence**: 1.2x position size boost  
- **<60% confidence**: 0.7x position size reduction

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. **Test the System**
```bash
# Test all advanced features
python test_advanced_features.py

# Test adaptive scaling specifically
python test_adaptive_scaling.py

# See comprehensive demo with real market data
python demo_adaptive_scaling.py
```

### 2. **Configure Your Settings**
Edit `config.json`:
```json
{
  "api_keys": {
    "coinmarketcap": "6cad35f36d7b4e069b8dcb0eb9d17d56"
  },
  "adaptive_scaling": {
    "base_position_size": 100.0,
