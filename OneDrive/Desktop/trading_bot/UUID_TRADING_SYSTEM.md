# 🎯 UUID-Linked Trading System Documentation

## Overview

This system implements **complete end-to-end trade tracking** with UUID linking, enabling full provenance from research → decision → execution → outcome. This foundation supports reliable ML model training, causal analysis, and safe automated parameter updates.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

## 🔑 Key Components

### 1. UUID-Linked Trade Tracking (`src/data/trade_tracking.py`)

**Core Classes:**
- `TradeCandidate`: Trade opportunity with UUID
- `ResearchDocument`: Immutable research snapshot 
- `ExecutionRecord`: Complete execution details
- `TradeOutcome`: Final results and metrics
- `TradeTrackingSystem`: Main orchestrator

**Database Schema:**
- `candidates`: Trade opportunities with UUID

## 📊 Data Flow

### 1. Trade Candidate Creation
```python
# Generate UUID and create candidate
candidate = tracker.create_candidate(
    instrument="PEPE/USDT",
    model_version="v1.2.3", 
    confidence=0.75,
    params_ptr="params_001",
    created_by="high_vol_strategy"
)
```

### 2. Research Document Storage
```python
# Store immutable research snapshot
research = ResearchDocument(
    uuid=candidate.uuid,
    contract_address="0x123...",
    initial_market_cap=1000000.0,
    rugpull_heuristic_scores={"risk": 0.3},
    social_sentiment_scores={"twitter": 0.65},
    trade_rationale="High social momentum + low risk",
    # ... complete research data
)
tracker.store_research_document(research)
```

### 3. Execution Tracking
```python
# Record trade execution
execution = ExecutionRecord(
    uuid=candidate.uuid,
    order_id="order_12345",
    entry_price=0.001,
    size=1000.0,
    slippage=0.002,
    latency_metrics={"latency_ms": 45}
)
tracker.store_execution_record(execution)
```

### 4. Outcome Recording
```python
# Store final results
outcome = TradeOutcome(
    uuid=candidate.uuid,
    realized_pnl_percent=15.5,
    time_in_market_seconds=3600,
    termination_reason=TerminationReason.PROFIT_TARGET
)
tracker.store_outcome(outcome)
```

## 🤖 ML Training Pipeline

### Feature Engineering
```python
# Extract features from UUID-linked data
engineer = FeatureEngineer(db_path="trades.db")
features_df = engineer.extract_all_features()

# Select top features
selected_df, features = engineer.select_features(features_df, k=50)

# Prepare ML dataset with time-based splits
ml_data = engineer.prepare_ml_dataset(selected_df)
```

### Safe Model Training
```python
# Train with safety validation
pipeline = SafeMLPipeline(db_path="trades.db")
new_model = pipeline.train_new_model()

# Deploy as canary
if new_model:
    pipeline.deploy_canary(new_model.version_id)
    
# Monitor and promote/rollback
pipeline.promote_canary_to_production(new_model.version_id)
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Trade Tracking
```python
# Initialize system
tracker = TradeTrackingSystem()

# Create and track a trade
candidate = tracker.create_candidate("BTC/USDT", "v1.0", 0.8, "params", "strategy")
# ... execute trade ...
# Store execution and outcome records

# Retrieve complete trade history
complete_record = tracker.get_complete_trade_record(candidate.uuid)
```

### High Volatility Strategy
```python
# Initialize strategy
strategy = HighVolatilityLowCapStrategy(
    small_fund_usd=1000.0,
    coinmarketcap_api_key="your_key",
    coingecko_api_key="your_key"
)

# Scan for opportunities
candidates = await strategy.scan_low_cap_opportunities()

# Create trade candidates with full tracking
for candidate in candidates:
    trade_candidate = await strategy.create_trade_candidate(candidate)
```

### Integrated Trading Bot
```python
# Start complete integrated system
bot = IntegratedTradingBot(
    small_fund_usd=1000.0,
    total_fund_usd=10000.0,
    coinmarketcap_api_key="your_key",
    coingecko_api_key="your_key"
)

# Run with all components
await bot.start_trading_session()
```

## 📈 Performance Monitoring

### Trade Metrics
```python
# Get comprehensive performance metrics
metrics = tracker.get_performance_metrics()
print(f"Total trades: {metrics['total_trades']}")
print(f"Win rate: {metrics['win_rate'] * 100:.1f}%")
print(f"Average return: {metrics['avg_return_pct']:.2f}%")
```

### ML Model Performance
```python
# Monitor model performance
summary = ml_pipeline.get_model_performance_summary()
active_model = ml_pipeline.get_active_model()
print(f"Active model R²: {active_model.metrics.r2_score:.3f}")
```

## 🔒 Security & Best Practices

### Data Privacy
- Research snapshots exclude PII from social content
- API keys stored securely (not in code)
- Database access controls implemented

### Storage Strategy
- Raw artifacts: Object store with 1-year retention
- Summarized features: Indefinite retention
- Hot feature lookups: Redis cache
- Time-series data: TimescaleDB/Postgres

### Safety Mechanisms
- Minimum sample count requirements (1000 trades/30 days)
- No negative impact on holdout performance
- Canary rollout with tight monitoring
- Automated rollback on regression detection
